Customer brief:
The customer is a company quite familiar with the EVM principles, planning to
launch a new dApp, but who never used any Consensys products. They reached out to the Customer Enablement Team of
Consensys to see how Consensys products could be used for building their dApp.

Their dApp will be a lending & borrowing platform where end-users can collateralize an NFT to borrow money.

Guidelines:
Develop a
PoC to demonstrate how one or many Consensys Products can be used for the customer's purpose. It is not expected
that the PoC covers all the features of a lending/borrowing platform, but instead, to cherry-pick a very limited
number of features that would allow you to showcase Consensys products integration and help the customer to clear
any technical difficulties he would have.

While on a kickoff call with the customer, you are asked to
describe the PoC you will create. What features will it provide and which Consensys products will be
used?

Tips:
● Focus on where you think that technical complexity would rely on the customer (eg: the dApp
will probably have to list the tokens owned by one user: how should the customer use Infura to get the list of
tokens owned by a user)
● The customer brief is unclear on purpose. Think ahead about the interrogations and
expectations of the customer (eg: why not use Linea for my dApp?)
● There is no right or wrong answer, you are
here to demonstrate your strengths (and not expose your weaknesses too much).
● The video should be no longer
than 3-minutes

I have this customer brief.


I need to create a poc for this brief. 

I would like to start by designing the contracts required to implement the lending and borrowing platform.

I will use the OpenZeppelin library to create the contracts.

I will create a contract that will allow users to deposit an NFT as collateral and borrow money.

I will need a stable coin to use as the currency for the lending and borrowing platform.

Can you please create the required contracts to implement the lending and borrowing platform?
